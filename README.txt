In this project, we will analyze the data coming from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms. Before ringing up the sale, cashiers call in a check to the FBI or to other designated agencies to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. More than 100 million such checks have been made in the last decade, leading to more than 700,000 denials.

Conclusions
- Kentucky has the highest growth in gun registrations, followed by Texas and California.
- Long guns are the most purchased, followed by Hand guns.
- There is annual increase in gun purchases, and specifically in 2016 the increase hit its maximum.
- It appears that handgun permits increase noticably in the states where the Hispanic or Latino Percent is high
- Hispanic or Latino Percent sure is not the only factor for increasing handgun sales, but it's an important factor and its effect is undeniable.
